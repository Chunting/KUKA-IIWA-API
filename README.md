# KUKA-IIWA-API
Ros Enable API for easy integration with the KUKA IIWA.

This repository contains the API detailed in:
Saeid Mokaram, Uriel Martinez-Hernandez, Jonathan M. Aitken, Iveta Eimontaite, David Cameron, James Law, Joe Rolph, Ian Gwilt. A ROS-integrated API for the KUKA LBR iiwa collaborative robot. Proceedings of the 20th World Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), Toulouse, France, 2017.

This repository presents an API for the KUKA Intelligent Industrial Work Assistant (iiwa) Lightweight Robot (LBR). This API has been developed to support our experimental research work, and is now supporting development of new industrial processes. This API builds upon the safety embedded within the KUKA iiwa to allow close working and interaction with operators. It brings the functionality into the Robot Operating System (ROS), which provides a distributed development environment allowing multiple new modalities of devices to interface easily.

See the Instruction.pdf for an instruction on running the API.
